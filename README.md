# Machine Lab AI Example

Short for "malicious software," malware refers to software programs designed to damage or do other unwanted actions on a computer system
Common examples of malware include viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware. Viruses, for example, can cause havoc on a computer's hard drive by deleting files or directory information. Spyware can gather data from a user's system without the user knowing it. This can include anything from the Web pages a user visits to personal information, such as credit card numbers.

It is unfortunate that there are software programmers out there with malicious intent, but it is good to be aware of the fact. You can install anti-virus and anti-spyware utilities on your computer that will seek and destroy the malicious programs they find on your computer.
A Machine Learning approach for classifying a file as Malicious or Legitimate.

This approach tries out 6 different classification algorithms before deciding which one to use for prediction by comparing their results.
Different Machine Learning models tried are, Linear Regression, RandomForest, DecisionTree,  Adaboost, Gaussian, Gradient Boosting.

In order to test the model on an unseen file, it's required to extract the characteristics of the given file. Python's pefile.PE library is used to construct and build the feature vector and a ML model is used to predict the class for the given file based on the already trained model. 

Dependencies
============

* pandas ```pip install pandas```
* numpy ```pip install numpy```
* pickle ```pip install pickle```
* scipy ```pip install scipy```
* scikit ```pip install -U scikit-learn```
